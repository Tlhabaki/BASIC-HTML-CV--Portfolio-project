    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a South African community leader, farmer, and entrepreneur dedicated to public safety and agricultural development. As the Public Relations Officer for the Haakdoornboom Sector 3 Community Policing Forum (CPF), I work to strengthen collaboration between the community and law enforcement to improve security. <br/>
    I run Emerald Dynasty Farm, where I cultivate okra, coriander, spinach and more for market supply. Beyond farming, I have developed custom digital tools using AppSheet to streamline farm management and invoicing. Always looking to grow and innovate, I am currently learning full-stack web development to expand my technological skills and create new opportunities.</p>
